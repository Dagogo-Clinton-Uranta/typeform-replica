         A multi tenant IP PBX signifies the concept of having multiple IP
          PBX solutions with a single software instance, which makes the 
          management of the software so easy. The instinctive GUI based
           panel to manage tenants and other elements such as DID numbers,
            extensions, rate plans, etc. is tremendously easy for the
             admin. The web based panels make access to software and 
             administration of business mobile and flexible. Now, with 
             a few taps or clicks from anywhere, you can control your 
             business communication tools and PBX service provider business.
